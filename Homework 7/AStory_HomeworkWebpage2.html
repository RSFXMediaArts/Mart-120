        <p style="text-indent: 40px" class="mediumText"><text-align: center;>Deep in the heart of the woods on the northern border of the kingdom of Hereden, a land of dark machinations and even darker magic, there rests a tiny cottage in a grassy clearing. It is dark, this cottage. Though the land around it is lit up by daylight, the small moss and mud-roofed building stays contantly in darkness. It is almost as though the shadows of the forest reach out to shelter around the log cabin.</text-align></p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px" class="mediumText"><text-align: center;>It is rumored that when the sun falls below the treeline, the cottage comes to life with the sounds of bubbling cauldrons, dark chanting and even darker languages not spoken by mortals for millenia. If you are lucky, or perhaps unlucky, you may see a figure emerge from within the cabin. A young woman cloaked in grey holding a staff and the decaying head of the once king of the North. Answer her calls and her riddles and you may receive a boon. But beware the blood moon, for that is when this same scene is littered with the wandering souls of the dead and their screams of undying torment.</text-align:></p><br />
